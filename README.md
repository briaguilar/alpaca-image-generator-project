# alpaca-image-generator-project
'Continuing Education' project for myself

Introduction
At DevProjects, we love alpacas! It's our mascot, and we'd love for you to have your own alpaca profile photo. With that said, this project is not just about alpacas. Allowing users to generate and download avatars are common in many interactive websites. In this project, you'll learn how to create an image generator website that allows users to generate, combine, and download images.

This project should take you approximately 8 hours to complete.

Requirements
- A website to let you customize your own alpaca profile picture (or desired image)
- Customization panel
- Randomize feature
- Download generated image feature

Suggested Implementation
- Get your image assets ready. You could use the alpaca images we provided or use your own ones for your image generator.
- Prepare your preferred front end stack. We recommend using tools like Create React App or Vue CLI if you want to have a quick setup.
- Create an alpaca (image) preview UI
- Add list of buttons for customizing your alpaca (image)
- Add randomized alpaca feature
